## Introduction

This is a Python program intended to manage torrents and eventually interface with Deluge. I wrote this program to manage torrents across Windows and Linux with an external drive. Torrents were downloaded in Windows with one client, but the torrent list could not be easily reconstructed in Deluge in Ubuntu.

## Todo

- Torrent sharing management
  - Share rare torrents
  - Do not share popular torrents

## Future

- Website interface
  - Priority task: will save time!
- Automatically create and upload torrent
- Streaming platform integration
